LittlePHP Framework
=========

LittlePHP is a simple and lightweight framework for writing web applications in PHP.

## Who I am
I'm a developer from China. So forgive me for my poor English.<br/>
I work with Objective-C, Java, C++, Python, Javascript.<br/>
And 3 months ago I began to learn PHP for a new project which provided Web Api for mobile games.

As everyone said, it's very easy to learn PHP language. <br />
By contrast, I spent much more time to find a handy editor than to learn PHP. <br />
At last I found PhpStorm. Thank JetBrains.
	
## Why a new framework
One project is to solve one problem.<br/>

I spent much time to find a handy framework.<br/>
At last, I gived up and decided to write my own framework.<br/>
Simple, Simple and Simple.
